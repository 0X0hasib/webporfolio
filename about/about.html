            <h3>About myself:</h3><br>
            <p>Hello, at first take my salam assalamualaikum.
                This is DM Hasibur Rahman and my nickname is Hasib.
                My father's name Md Zakir Hossain and he is a businessman.
                My mother's name is Mst Mahmuda Akter and she is a teacher.
                I am from Jamalpur. We are two brother but no sister.
                I am the first of my parents. I was born on May 30, 2001.
                And in 2006 I was admitted to Ganim International School.
                My class 5 result was GPA-4.75. I changed class 8 school
                and got admission in new school and successfully achieved GPA-5.
                I got 4.86 in class 10 from the same school.
                Admission to the next Advance Recidensial Model College,
                Mymensingh.In 2019 I passed HSC. December, 2019 I was admitted to
                Daffodil International University. Now, I am the student of Daffodil international University.
                Now, I would like to say something about my like and dislike.
                My favourite game badminton and my favourite colour black and white.
                I like honesty and dislike speaking ill of others hypocrisy and gossiping etc.
                Right now, I would like to tell you about my hobby. In your life,
                It is good to have a hobby me to. My hobby is playing badminton.
                I started play badminton when I was 10 years old. I usually share this with
                my friends to do this hobby. I need racket and shuttle. I think my hobby is very
                interesting. I would I like it very much. So I will keep this habby forever.
                Everybody has an aim in life because an aimless life is like a boat without boatman.
                So my aim in life is like to be an engineer. I am proud of my family
                and also proud of my new family that is DIU PC-Q section. My superhero is my father.
                I think I thanked him for admit me at Daffodil international University.
                My father is always work hard for our goodness of the family. I am proud of my father.
                Thank you for listening to me. That's all about me today
